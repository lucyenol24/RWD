    Time appears to be moving faster and faster each day. Not that long ago, having a cell phone was considered a luxury. Now, if you don’t have a cell phone, tablet, and a game console, you’re behind the times. Keeping up with such a rapid pace can be exhausting. This is where our hero, Responsive Web Design, comes in. RWD embraces these changes with flexibility and fluidity. These days, websites and applications can appear on a plethora of mediums. Desktops, television, cell phones, tablets, watches… even on refrigerator doors! RWD bridges the gap between all the different shapes of sizes of devices folks are using to access the internet these days. It makes going from the standard desktop computer version to a wrist watch seamless. RWD takes the attributes from the website or application, and molds them to whatever is required. As time continues to fly by, the importance of this is impeccable. Long ago are the days of mobile websites. RWD is the future.
